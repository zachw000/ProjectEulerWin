There are two main approaches to using the project euler solver:

    1. Using the command line arguments:
        . `./pesolver <problem number> <options>`
            - Runs the problem outputs to standard output
        . `./pesolver help`
            - Opens help dialog
    2. Using the interactive terminal:
        . `./pesolver`
            - Opens terminal emulator where multiple project euler problems
            may be solved.
